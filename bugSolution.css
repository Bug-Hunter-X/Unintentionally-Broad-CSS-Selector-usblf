The solution is to make the selector more specific, targeting only the paragraphs intended for styling. This can be achieved by adding a parent selector or using a class or ID.  The corrected code might look like this:

```css
#mySection p {
  color: blue;
}
/*or*/
.myParagraphClass {
  color: blue;
}
```

This approach ensures only paragraphs within the element with the ID `mySection` or elements with the class `myParagraphClass` are affected.  This precision prevents unintended styling and improves code maintainability.
